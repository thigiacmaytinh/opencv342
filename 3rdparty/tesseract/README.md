## About

This package contains an **OCR engine** - `libtesseract` and a **command line program** - `tesseract`.

The lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny.
For a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/AUTHORS)
and GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).

Tesseract has **unicode (UTF-8) support**, and can **recognize more than 100 languages** "out of the box".

Tesseract supports **various output formats**: plain-text, hocr(html), pdf, tsv, invisible-text-only pdf.

You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to **[improve the quality](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality) of the image** you are giving Tesseract.

This project **does not include a GUI application**. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty) wiki page.

Tesseract **can be trained to recognize other languages**. See [Tesseract Training](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract) for more information.

## Brief history

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and
at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some
more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998.
In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.

The latest stable version is **[3.05.01](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/3.05.01)**, released on June 1, 2017. Latest source code for 3.05 is available from [3.05 branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/3.05).

Source code for the new **[LSTM based 4.0 version](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)** is available from the master branch on GitHub. Please note this branch is under active development.

See **[Release Notes](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ReleaseNotes)** and **[Change Log](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/ChangeLog)** for more details of the releases.

## Installing Tesseract

You can either [Install Tesseract via pre-built binary package](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) or [build it from source](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling).

Supported Compilers are:

* GCC 4.8 and above
* Clang 3.4 and above
* MSVC 2015, 2017

Other compilers might work, but are not officially supported.

## Running Tesseract

Basic **[command line usage](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Command-Line-Usage)**:

    tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]

For more information about the various command line options use `tesseract --help` or `man tesseract`.

## For developers

Developers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/src/api/capi.h) or [C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/src/api/baseapi.h) API to build their own application. If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the [wrapper](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/AddOns#tesseract-wrappers) section on AddOns wiki page.

Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](http://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).
